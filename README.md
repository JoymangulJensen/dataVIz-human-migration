# Data visualization to study human migration for each country
Projet for the Data visualization classes 

## Project
On [our website](https://joymanguljensen.github.io/dataVIz-human-migration/), you will see the result of our work on the study of migration between 2000 and 2015. See the [intermediate report](https://github.com/JoymangulJensen/dataVIz-human-migration/blob/master/Reports/Intermediate/studying-human-migration.pdf) for more details.

We have used:
- [d3.js](https://d3js.org/) for the implementation of the map
- the [migration data](https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=MIG) from the OECD
- the GDP data from ? (add link)

This project is part of a school project, following [these guidelines](https://lyondataviz.github.io/teaching/lyon1-m2/2017/projets.html).
